## How It Works

- Visitors land on the website and navigate through four main pages: **Home**, **About**, **Services**, and **Contact** using the fixed header navigation.  
- The **Services** page breaks down offerings into clear categories, making it easy for visitors to find the right service. Each service card provides a concise description and price estimate.  
- The floating bars in the background provide a subtle animated effect to keep the page visually interesting.  
- Hovering over navigation links and service cards triggers smooth animations that enhance user interaction without overwhelming the content.  
- The call-to-action section invites potential clients to initiate contact via a bold, animated button.  
- Contact details are readily available below the call to action, including email and phone number, along with an expected response time.  
- The website uses CSS Grid for layout and responsive media queries to ensure the design adapts perfectly to different screen sizes.  
- Accessibility features ensure the site is usable by keyboard users and meets common best practices.
